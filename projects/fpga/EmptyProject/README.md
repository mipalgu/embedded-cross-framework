# EmptyProject

This project demonstrates the ability to compile vivado projects using the `embedded-cross-framework`.

## Requirements

- Vivado 2022.1 or higher.
- CMake version 3.12 or higher.

## Compiling using the Framework

To include a vivado project within the `embedded-cross-framework`, create a new directory in `embedded-cross-framework/projects/fpga`. This directory will contain the relevant `cmake` files and the vivado project. Next, create a new subdirectory within this directory that will contain the vivado project files and source files. By default, the system will assume you have named this folder `vivado_project`, but you may override this behaviour by setting `${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}_PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME`. To avoid tracking the large vivado project, we have ignored it for this example, so you will have to create your own vivado project within the `vivado_project` folder for this demonstration. Lastly, create a new `project.cmake` with the language set to `HDL` and the project name set to the name of your directory within `projects/fpga`.

To start compiling this project, you may follow the same syntax as all other projects. For Example, to compile using vivado with a Zybo Z720 board, you may invoke the following commands from your terminal:

```shell
cd embedded-cross-framework
# configure
cmake --preset fpga-xilinx-unknown-vivado -DPROJECTS=EmptyProject -DBOARDS=zybo_z720
# build
cmake --build --preset fpga-xilinx-unknown-vivado
```

The generated bitstream is located at
```
embedded-cross-framework/.build/fpga-xilinx-unknown-vivado/EmptyProject_zybo_z720/vivado_project/EmptyProject.runs/impl_1/EmptyProject_zybo_z720.bit
```

You can upload the bitstream to your device via:
```shell
# install
cmake --build --target install --preset fpga-xilinx-unknown-vivado
```

Alternatively, you may clean the build artefacts via:
```shell
# clean
cmake --build --target xilinx-clean --preset fpga-xilinx-unknown-vivado
```
